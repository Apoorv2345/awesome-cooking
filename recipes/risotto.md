# Risotto

## Basic method

Risotto is, in all honesty, just about the most unjustly dreaded dish next to steak. It's very easy to make, fairly easy to make well, it just takes some time.

All said and done though, it's rice cooked in stock and finished with butter and parmesan. Even if it's bad, it's still pretty good.

### Ingredients
- 200g arborio rice (or other short-grain rice, I've accidentally used sushi rice once with decent results)
- 1L stock (I tend to use chicken stock, but any stock will work. Just remember this is the most important flavour, so make sure it's a good stock)
- 75ml white wine
- 2 shallots, finely diced (Yes, French chefs will tell you the onion should be diced to the same size as the rice. No, this is not necessary at all.)
- 1 clove garlic, finely diced
- 50g butter
- 50g parmesan cheese
- olive oil

### Method
- Heat some olive oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Be gentle, this dish takes time more than anything.
- Sauté the shallots
- When the shallots turn slightly translucent, add the garlic and the (uncooked!) rice
- Stir occasionally and let it all toast until the rice grains turn translucent on the outer edges
- Pour wine into the pan and keep stirring until all the wine is absorbed
- Add stock, one ladle at a time
- Keep stirring and add one ladle more stock when all the stock is absorbed
- Repeat previous step until rice is cooked. Taste for seasoning and add pepper and salt as desired
- Take the pan off the heat and add the butter and parmesan cheese. Stir until completely melted through

That's it, you made risotto. From here, you can vary endlessly, but if you're lacking some inspiration, here are some ideas:

### Basic variations
- You can add a protein and a vegetable as desired. Diced chicken breast and green beans work well, just cook them in advance and add them when the last ladle of stock is almost absorbed
- Instead of the garlic and onions, you can use a [soffritto](soffritto.md)
- You can use red wine instead of white wine for bolder flavours (pairs well with beef stock, sausage meat as a filling, and topped with walnuts)


## Ridiculously good butternut squash risotto

### Ingredients (additional to basic method ingredients)
- 1 butternut squash
- Sage leaves
- Use vegetable stock to keep it light

### Method
- Preheat the oven on 180°C (350°C)
- Peel and chop the squash in 1cm cubes (microwaving the squash for 30 seconds helps immensely with this)
- Spread out on an oven tray, drizzle with olive oil, and add roughly chopped sage leaves
- Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes
- Take half the squash out of the oven tray. It should be soft, if not, put it back for a little bit.
- Put the other half back into the oven until the edges start to brown
- Mash the half of the squash you took out of the oven, with the sage
- Make risotto as described in basic method
- Don't forget about the squash in the oven
- When the rice is almost done, add the mashed squash
- Finish risotto as usual with butter and parmesan
- Add the roasted squash cubes
- If you're feeling extra fancy, gently fry some sage leaves in a bit of oil until crispy and use as a garnish
- Serve with wine
- Take carb-induced nap after eating
