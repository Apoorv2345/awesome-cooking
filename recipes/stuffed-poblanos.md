# Stuffed poblano peppers

## Ingredients
- 6 large poblano peppers
- 500g sausage meat
- white rice (I have no idea of the exact amount, I just cooked maybe 50g of it and added what I needed)
- 1 small can black beans
- 1 small can corn
- cumin powder
- garlic powder
- chilli flakes
- 1 fresh chilli pepper (I use a serrano, but use what you like), chopped
- grated cheese

## Method
- Preheat an oven to 180°C (350°F)
- Cook the white rice
- Halve and deseed the poblanos, but leave on the stalk. It's easiest to make a little cut on the back of the seeds and just tear them out.
- Bake the halved poblano peppers on an oven tray, skin side down, for about 10 minutes just to soften them
- Meanwhile, heat some oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
- Sauté the chopped chilli pepper for a little while
- Put the sausage meat in there, break up into small chunks
- Add cumin, garlic powder, chilli flakes, pepper and salt to taste, mix well, and leave to brown for a bit
- Once the fat from the sausage meat has rendered out a bit, put the rice in the skillet. I used roughly the same amount of rice as there was sausage meat
- Let the rice soak up all the lovely sausage fat, and keep stirring until the sausage meat is browned and cooked through
- Once the sausage is cooked, drain and add the corn and black beans, stir through, and heat for about 1 minute before turning off the heat
- Remove your poblano peppers from the oven if you haven't already, and leave to cool for a little bit
- Spoon the sausage filling into the peppers
- Cover the filled peppers with grated cheese
- Bake in the oven for an additional 10 minutes until the cheese is just starting to brown
- Let cool for a bit and serve
