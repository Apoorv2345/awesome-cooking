# Thai yellow curry paste

## Ingredients
- 4 bulbs garlic (Yes, bulbs. Not cloves. Bulbs. Also, more bigger is more better.)
- 4 large shallots
- 1 fairly large piece of ginger (about 15 cm or so, I guess)
- 4 tbsp tumeric
- 4 tbsp mild curry powder
- 3 tbsp ground coriander seeds
- 1.5 tbsp salt (yes, it's a lot, but you won't be eating it all at once so no worries)
- A large bunch of coriander, stalks and all (roughly chopped for easier blitzing)
- 4 tbsp Lemongrass paste
- 5 to 20 dried thai bird's eye chilies (the tiny red ones, 5 for mild, 20 for that authentic burning gums feel and/or digestive problems)
- Olive oil

## Method
- Preheat your oven at 180 °C (350 °F)
- Peel and thinly slice the ginger, arrange in a single layer on some tinfoil, drizzle with oil and wrap it up
- Peel the shallots, drizzle with oil, and wrap up in tinfoil
- Remove the outer paper from the garlic, cut off the topmost bit, and drizzle each bulb in oil and individually wrap in foil
- Put the foil packets in the oven
- After 15 minutes, remove the ginger - it should be softened. Don't be an ass like me and leak hot ginger oil all over your kitchen.
- Leave the rest to roast for half an hour longer, everything should be softened and slightly browned.
- Boil some water and pour over the chilies, leave to rehydrate for 15 minutes
- Suppress raging appetite caused by delicious smells from oven
- Remove everything from the oven when done
- Once everything from the oven has cooled down, chuck all the ingredients into a food processor or blender (squeeze the garlic cloves out of the bulb, don't add the paper). Don't forget the oils and juices from the tinfoil packets!
- Blitz until it's a paste, add some oil if needed

## Usage
When using, heat some oil in a pan, add the paste and let it heat for a bit, then add coconut milk to make it a curry sauce and mix well. Add proteins and veggies as cooking time demands. I use about 1-2 tbsp of paste for 2 people, but adjust to taste as always. Delicious with shrimp and sugar snaps over white rice. Needs little to no additional flavouring, but some extra onions and garlic is never a bad thing. Keeps well in an airtight container in the fridge (at least a month I'd say), and freezes well too, so it might be best to just have a smaller portion sitting in the fridge and keep the rest in the freezer for when the first portion runs out.
