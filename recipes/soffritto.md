# Soffritto

Soffritto is the basis for many Italian foods and good even by itself. Different kitchens have a similar starting point with slightly different ingredients and often you can replace or leave them out based on your tastes.

## You'll need

- Oil - either sunflower or olive oil has worked well for me although you could use any cooking oil you prefer
- Garlic - 2-3 cloves
- Onions - either red or white will do and you can use both
- Carrots
- Celery

The mixing ratio between onions, carrots, and celery is roughly 2:1:1 although you can alter this.

## Method

- Cut onions, carrots, and celery to fine pieces
- Start by heating a few tbsp of oil (be generous! You'll need a fair bit) in a wok or skillet on medium-high heat. Sauté the garlic and onions
- Add the carrots and celery to the mix and sauté till the the vegetables lose their liquid. You can speed up the process by adding a bit of salt. You can also add a pinch of pepper and other spices. Balsamic vinegar can work as well.

## Variants

Soffritto is good by itself but often it's a good idea to turn it into something else. To give you a better idea, consider the following variants:

### Pasta sauce

- Prepare soffritto
- Add a can of tomatoes, or fresh ones sliced, to the mix. Some add a tiny bit of sugar to counter the acidity although this is an optional step.
- Add optionally sausage (salsiccia), olives, capers, beans, and other things you prefer.
- While cooking the sauce, cook pasta.
- Once pasta is done, enjoy together with parmesan and olive oil sprinkled on top.

### Minestrone

- Follow the pasta sauce recipe.
- Instead of using a pan, use a pot.
- To make it more soupy, add a couple of desiliters of water to the mix.
- Consider adding potatoes cut to small cubes to the mix. Pasta can be added directly to the sauce as well.
- Cook till everything is soft and enjoy similarly as pasta and sauce above.
