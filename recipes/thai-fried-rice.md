# Thai fried rice
## You'll need:
- Cooked rice (preferably day-old, but freshly cooked is fine, from about 75g uncooked per person as a side or 100g uncooked if served as a main dish)
- Finely sliced chilies (to taste, my favourite batch to date used 1 serrano chili for 2 people but use however much you like)
- Garlic or garlic paste
- Grated ginger or ginger paste
- Sereh/lemongrass paste (I use 3 tsp garlic, 2 tsp lemongrass, 1 tsp ginger for  2 people, but this recipe is fairly forgiving in ratios and amounts used)
- Oyster sauce (~2 tbsp for 2 people as a starting point)
- Fish sauce (~1 tbsp for 2 people as a starting point)
- Chopped basil, lots (this should probably be thai basil, but that's kinda hard to get here, give it a whirl and let me know how it tastes)
- Chopped coriander, lots
- 1 Finely diced or sliced red onion or 2 shallots given the same treatment
- Whatever protein/veggies you're planning to serve with it, I tend to make garlic shrimp
- Lime juice
- Lime wedges (pro tip: roll a lime over a cutting board with firm pressure, then cut off the "cheeks" on opposing sides of the lime. Squeeze the middle out during cooking, serve with the cut-off cheeks)
- Optional: cassava crackers (but highly recommended if you're serving this as a meal)

## Method
- Start by heating a few tbsp of oil (be generous! You'll need a fair bit) in a wok or skillet on medium-high heat. Sauté the chilies for a bit, then add the garlic paste, lemongrass and ginger and let it sauté for a little bit (not too long or you'll burn the pastes)
- Add the rice and mix thoroughly (every grain of rice should be coated, ideally). Let the rice fry for a few minutes while mixing.
- Add your fish sauce and oyster sauce and mix thoroughly. Check for seasoning, and add more oyster sauce if you need more saltiness (more fish sauce can be used too, but the flavour isn't very pleasant if you overdo it)
- Add the basil and coriander, mix thoroughly, then turn off the heat
- Stir through your protein and/or veggies if you want to, or serve them separately. I like to mix in garlic shrimp but serve other proteins separately.
- Stir through the onions or shallots and stir through, finish with the lime juice to taste
- Serve with the lime wedges/cheeks and cassava crackers

Recommended eating is to scoop up the rice with the cassava crackers, wolf down the entire thing, then lamenting not making enough for two days because you could totally eat another serving or two
